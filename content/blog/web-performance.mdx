# Web Performance Optimization Guide

Web performance directly impacts user experience, SEO rankings, and conversion rates. Here's how to make your website lightning fast.

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals are essential metrics to track:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Loading performance
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Interactivity
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Visual stability

## Optimization Strategies

### Image Optimization

Images often account for the majority of page weight:

- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement lazy loading
- Serve responsive images
- Compress images properly

### Code Splitting

Break your JavaScript into smaller chunks:

```javascript
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
```

### Caching Strategies

Implement effective caching:

- Browser caching
- CDN caching
- Service worker caching

## Monitoring Performance

Regular monitoring is crucial:

- Use Lighthouse for audits
- Monitor real user metrics
- Set performance budgets
- Test on various devices

Performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.
