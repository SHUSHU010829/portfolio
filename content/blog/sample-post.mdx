# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks for building React applications, and when combined with TypeScript, it provides an incredible developer experience with type safety and modern features.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:

- **Server-side rendering** (SSR) out of the box
- **Static site generation** (SSG) for better performance
- **API routes** for full-stack applications
- **Automatic code splitting** for optimized loading

## Setting up TypeScript

Setting up TypeScript with Next.js is incredibly simple. Just create a `tsconfig.json` file and Next.js will automatically configure everything for you.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
```

## Example Component

Here's a simple TypeScript component:

```tsx
interface Props {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

export function Card({ title, description }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {description && <p>{description}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This combination of Next.js and TypeScript provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications.
